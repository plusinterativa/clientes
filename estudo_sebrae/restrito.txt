/plusmanage




You MUST edit /wp-config.php to make new admin path work: 
Open wp-config.php using FTP and add following line somewhere before require_once(...) (or update it with new value): 
define("ADMIN_COOKIE_PATH", "/estudo_sebrae/wwwroot/plusmanage");

You also need to update your .htaccess file by adding following line before 'RewriteCond REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f': 
RewriteRule ^plusmanage/(.*) /wp-admin/$1 [QSA,L]
